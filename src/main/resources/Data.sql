*   **Duplication Restrictions:** Courses in the major (required, track, or elective) cannot count toward General Education requirements.
*   **Level Distribution:**  While not explicitly stated, a balanced distribution of course levels (lower and upper division) is often expected, especially within the elective categories.
*   **Specializations/Tracks:** The document does NOT specify any explicitly defined specializations, tracks, or concentrations within the BSE program. However, the list of BSE Electives suggests areas of emphasis, such as Finance or Economic Policy, which a student might informally choose to focus on.
*   **Capstone:** ECON 299 is a capstone course. Completion typically occurs in the senior year and often requires specific prerequisites to be met.
*   **Armenian Language/History DegreeRequirement:** Students who graduated from an RoA school where instruction was in Armenian take Armenian language and history courses; others take the courses in English. This affects which courses are required from the FND foundation list.

*   **Lab Units:**  The Environmental Monitoring Lab, Biology Lab, Chem Lab, and Geology Lab each carry 1 unit, though the document doesn''t specify credit-hours-per-unit.
*   **No Explicit Specialization/Track:**  The document doesn''t outline specific specializations or tracks within the ESS major.  Course selection within the Project-Based Electives could implicitly create a focus area.
*   **Duplication Restrictions:**  Standard university rules would likely prevent a student from receiving credit for substantially similar courses.
*   **Upper-Level DegreeRequirement:** Not stated here, but it is possible that a certain number of the 43 courses must be upper-level (300/400).
*  **GenEd categories:** The 15 General Education courses will likely be distributed among different areas (e.g. Humanities, Social Science, natural Sciences, Fine Arts), and students might have some choices within these areas.

*   **Graduate Course Restrictions:**  CHSS 380 and CHSS 381 (Translation Studies) require permission, suggesting they are graduate-level.

**V. Additional Requirements:**

    *   FND 152 First Aid - One course. First semester.
    *   FND 153 Civil Defense - One course. First semester.
    *   _Note: These are non-credit requirements._

**VI. Graduation Requirements Summary:**

*   The document doesn''t explicitly state the total number of credits required for graduation, but it can be inferred:
    *   GE: Appoximately 36 credits (12 courses x 3 credits/course)
    *   Major Core: 28 courses
    *   Distribution DegreeRequirement: 2 courses x 3 credits = 6 credits
    *   Free Electives: 9 credits
    *   Inferred Total credit requirement: 36+28+6+9 = ~79 credits. This is a minimum.

**VII. Important Considerations (Based on Inference and Common Practices):**

*   **Prerequisites:** The document doesn''t explicitly list prerequisites for each course. However, it is very likely that courses like Calculus 1, Calculus 2, Calculus 3, and Introduction to Programming have prerequisites. Future recommendations will need to consider assumed/standard prerequisites for these and other courses.
*   **Level Distribution:** The document doesn''t explicitly specify any requirements for the distribution of courses across different academic levels (e.g., 100-level, 200-level, etc.). However, many universities have such requirements, either formally or informally, influencing course selection.
*   **Duplication Restrictions:** The document doesn''t explicitly address restrictions on duplicating courses. The presence of "Systems Engineering" in both the core and distribution options suggests that a student might be able to choose a different course for the distribution requirement if they take it as part of the core.
*   **GPA:** While not listed here, most degree programs also require a minimum cumulative GPA for graduation.
