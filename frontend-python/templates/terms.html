    <h1>Totally Reasonable Terms & Conditions</h1>
    <div class="terms-box">
        <p>
            Please take a moment (or an entire coffee break) to pretend you're reading the following very serious and binding terms:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>This planner is powered by caffeine, unstable Wi-Fi, and blind academic optimism.</li>
            <li>You agree that if this tool gives you a course schedule that requires 48 hours in a day, you’ll just deal with it.</li>
            <li>Your student ID will not be used for evil purposes... unless a good villain offers us tenure.</li>
            <li>This application is legally prohibited from granting actual course credit, free pizza, or immortality.</li>
            <li>You agree not to summon eldritch academic entities via this planner’s prompts.</li>
            <li>The suggested course plan is 60% logic, 40% vibes. Your results may vary.</li>
            <li>By using this tool, you promise to at least try attending classes — no guarantees, just vibes.</li>
            <li>Your soul remains yours, unless you check the “I agree” box and also whisper your GPA into a cursed USB stick.</li>
            <li>This app accepts no responsibility for emotional damage caused by morning classes.</li>
            <li>You may experience spontaneous flashbacks to prerequisite courses you forgot existed.</li>
            <li>If your course load summons a temporal paradox, please report it as a bug.</li>
            <li>You must not use this planner to escape group work unless you bring snacks for the dev team.</li>
            <li>We do not monitor your data, unless it starts talking to us first.</li>
            <li>All degree suggestions are subject to interpretation, planetary alignment, and mood swings of the central algorithm.</li>
            <li>Accepting these terms also registers you for a metaphorical journey of self-discovery (optional, non-refundable).</li>
            <li>This tool has not been approved by the Galactic University Board... yet.</li>
            <li>If your academic advisor becomes suspicious of your sudden course confidence, deny everything.</li>
            <li>Do not operate this planner while emotionally compromised or listening to dramatic film scores.</li>
            <li>You agree not to sue us if your semester plan makes you question your life choices. That’s college.</li>
            <li>Terms and conditions may change mid-sentence, in accordance with chaotic-neutral coding standards.</li>
            <li>If you've read this far, you clearly deserve an honorary degree in Satirical Terms Studies (the secret Degree Program).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Use of this tool constitutes acknowledgment that reality is optional, and academic survival is a shared hallucination.
        </p>
